# Would You Rather Project

## Project Setup
* clone the Project - `https://github.com/JesusReyes01/would-you-rather.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`

## Description
This Web App was created to solify my understanding of React and Redux after completing the Udacity Redux section of the React course. This Web App lets the user play the "Would You Rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## Planning

The UI planning was done on Figma and can be viewed [here]("https://www.figma.com/file/eNsnuSPeqVR6RLBkD0MgMA/Would-you-rather?node-id=0%3A1")
